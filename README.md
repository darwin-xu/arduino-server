# üçé Food Analysis & Nutrition Tracker

A Node.js web server for automated food image recognition and nutrition analysis. The system is designed to work with equipment that automatically captures and weighs food, then transmits the data to the server for analysis.

## Features

- ü§ñ **Automated Equipment Integration**: Receives data from food analysis equipment via HTTP API
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Automatic Weight Detection**: Equipment provides precise weight measurements
- üîç **Food Recognition**: Analyze uploaded images (currently using mock data, ready for AI integration)
- üìä **Nutrition Analysis**: Get detailed nutritional information based on weight and food type
- üí° **Health Suggestions**: Receive personalized health recommendations
- üì± **Real-time Display**: Results appear automatically on the web interface
- üñ•Ô∏è **Clean Interface**: Simple welcome page that displays analysis results

## System Architecture

- **Equipment**: Captures images and weighs food automatically
- **Web Server**: Processes data and provides analysis
- **Web Interface**: Displays welcome message and shows results in real-time
- **Simulator**: Included for testing and demonstration

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **File Upload**: Multer
- **HTTP Client**: Axios, form-data
- **Security**: Helmet, CORS
- **Logging**: Morgan
- **Environment**: dotenv
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Code Formatting**: Prettier

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd food-analysis-server
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Create environment file:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

4. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5. Open your browser and visit: `http://localhost:3000`

## Equipment Simulation

To test the system without physical equipment, use the included simulator:

1. **Single test run:**

    ```bash
    npm run simulate-once
    ```

2. **Continuous simulation (every 10 seconds):**

    ```bash
    npm run simulate
    ```

3. **Add sample images for better simulation:**
    ```bash
    # Copy your food images to the sample-images folder
    cp /path/to/food/images/* sample-images/
    ```

For detailed simulator documentation, see [EQUIPMENT-SIMULATOR.md](EQUIPMENT-SIMULATOR.md)

## Scripts

- `npm start` - Start the production server
- `npm run dev` - Start the development server with auto-restart
- `npm run simulate` - Run equipment simulator continuously
- `npm run simulate-once` - Run equipment simulator once
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run format:check` - Check code formatting
